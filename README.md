# Beginning Application Development with TensorFlow and Keras
With this course, you'll learn how to train, evaluate, and deploy Tensorflow and Keras models as real-world web applications. After a hands-on introduction to neural networks and deep learning, you'll use a sample model to explore details of deep learning and learn to select the right layers that can solve a given problem. By the end of the course, you'll build a Bitcoin application that predicts the future price, based on historic and freely available information.


## What you will learn
* Learn ways to select the right model architecture
*	Make predictions with a trained model and work with TensorBoard
*	Evaluate metrics and techniques to deploy a model as a web application
*	Set up a deep learning programming environment
*	Explore components of a neural network and its essential operations
*	Deploy model as an interactive web application with Flask and HTTP API
*	Learn to use Keras, a TensorFlow abstraction library
*	Explore types of problems that are addressed by neural networks



### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: 2.6 GHz or higher, preferably multi-core
* **Memory**: 4GB RAM
* **Hard disk**: 10GB or more
* An Internet connection



### Software requirements
Youâ€™ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Operating System: Windows (8 or higher)
*	[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
*	[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*	TensorFlow 1.4 or higher on Windows: Follow instructions in [website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows)
*	[Keras 2](https://keras.io/#installation)
